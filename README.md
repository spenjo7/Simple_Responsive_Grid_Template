## Title: Simple Responsive Grid Template

## Description:
This is a template for an HTML page which includes a very lightweight and responsive grid ( along with a div for a menu bar on top ). Currently, the HTML, CSS, and JS pages are under 1kb each. This page has little functionality of it's own, but rather is a boilerplate which can be easily adapted to any number of purposes. With this project, I attempted to make the CSS as minimalistic as possible and it can easily be copy pasted into an existing style sheet.

## How to use: ( 2 Main Options )
1. Use the existing files as a starting point and add your own Content/Scripts to them.
2. Copy the '.grid' class ( and, if desired, it's subsidiaries ) from the .css file and paste it into your own css. 
Then, add a <div class="grid"> element to your HTML; any <div> elements that are directly nested within it will automatically become grid cells.
